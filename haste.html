                <p class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    Grocery shopping has generally three types of people in the world. Shoppers who are impatient, shoppering who use coupons to save money, and the third shopper who doesn’t really care. I know that most of the time people are the third shopper because it is always great to save time and money. During my research I didn’t find many applications that make shopping easier except Sams Club. The more advanced version of this application is Amazons grocery store which is extremely technology based. Shopping in stores need to get with the times and needs to innovate. As of right now it isn’t as seamless as it could be.

                    I decided to follow IDEO’s Human-centered Design. Also implemented Lean UX Design Thinking to make sure that my design decisions were supported by user research and feedback

                        This application became an idea after realizing that shopping has been the same for awhile and with technology growing it can be improved and made easier for everyone. I began looking at how other stores had their applications set up like Target, Sams Club, etc. I began observing my daily activities as I shopped and the type of people who were in these stores.
