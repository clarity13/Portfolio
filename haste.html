                    Grocery shopping has generally three types of people in the world. Shoppers who are impatient, shoppers who use coupons to save money, and the third shopper who doesn’t really care. I know that most of the time people are the third shopper because it is always great to save time and money. During my research, I didn’t find many applications that make shopping easier except Sams Club. The more advanced version of this application is Amazons grocery store which is extremely technology based. Shopping in stores need to get with the times and needs to innovate. As of right now, it isn’t as seamless as it could be.

                    I decided to follow IDEO’s Human-centered Design. Also implemented Lean UX Design Thinking to make sure that my design decisions were supported by user research and feedback.

                        This application became an idea after realizing that shopping has been the same for awhile and with technology growing it can be improved and made easier for everyone. I began looking at how other stores had their applications set up like Target, Sams Club, etc. I began observing my daily activities as I shopped and the type of people who were in these stores.

                    Surveys were sent out to get an idea of what type of users would most likely use this product and what their habits are. According to the results, it became aware to me that not many users took advantage of coupons which in my case I do not also sometimes myself. It is way too much work to always be carrying around coupons. I took note of this as well as trying to figure out if people are tech-savvy. A lot of people in supermarkets are also baby boomers and some or not that great with technology. Of course the older generation they will have smartphones but some users aren't as familiar with technology. Knowing that I planned on making the layout of the application as simple as possible.

                            Many of the competitors had their own strengths but were a little lackluster. Grocery Pal had the prices of some of the items but it didn’t feel complete as they didn’t have specific brands. Cartwheel is a Target only app which only has coupons. Big Oven is an application that helps you find recipes which is very useful for someone who loves to try to cook new things. Breaking down all of their strengths and weaknesses will give an idea of how Haste will stand up to the competition and go above and beyond their limitations.

                            With all apps, I wanted to make it as seamless as possible. With that Figuring out how a user would use the application came down to researching how other great applications worked. The most important user flows were the actual sign up process because if it was complicated it would deter many users from actually even trying to use Haste. The two other important aspects of the application were the way you add items to the cart which is based off scanning items with the camera of your phone. The third important aspect is the checkout which had to show everything that you are buying so that you know what you are paying for. Once you are satisfied with what you see you may pay with a push of a button.

                        Starting the process of the low fidelity mockups on Sketch made everything easier to know how much information can fit on a specific screen. I wanted to give the users of this application a way to make their experience as fluid as possible. With that in mind, the actual cart would have pictures in place so that you know exactly what you are buying. I believe the most important part of this is to know where your money is going so I decided to implement receipts for all past purchases.

                        I realized during the mockups that I had to keep in mind designing for everyone. While this is easier said than done I tried implementing features that users wouldn’t think about needing. Time is of the essence all the time these days so having a way to save yourself time was the main goal. Trying to figure out placements of all the features was always a problem. I learned visuals are great but not to overwhelm the user with it.

                        During my first iteration of the homepage was simple and to the point but it seemed to be missing some personality to it. That being said the other two versions is when I added a recipes page to further grab the retention of users. I personally thought that Homepage 2 had a nice appeal but after multiple testings, it turned out homepage 3 was liked by 63% of users. After taking a step back I didn’t understand the appeal but with further research, I did make a mistake of thinking homepage 2 was the best fit.

                        Having multiple layouts whether it is obvious or not that one is better than the other is irrelevant. Having options always helps and brings out which design works better. In this case layout 3 was preferred with 88% of users because of the visual hierarchy. Doing this, solidified which layout I was going to continue with through testing.

                        Buttons are a huge part of an app being user-friendly. If they are too small then you have a terrible experience. The preference here is scattered but I saw myself gravitating towards the circular buttons as it was visually more appealing. The only issue that it was a little small for people who had smaller phones. I knew this only after implementing tests, I made a mistake thinking everyone had similar phone sizes and I adapted to the smaller screens.

                        Colors were created in a way for the user to feel welcomed so that when the app is opened they would want to engage with it. The colors have fun tones but should not be used all over the place because it would make it a little overwhelming.

                        Roboto condensed is a very familiar typeface that is easy on the eyes. Raleway is mostly used in headings to give hierarchy. Raleway also tends to gives off a friendly and welcoming vibe with its typeface.

                            Haste came about while I was thinking about how can I make my life easier. One day it dawned on me that shopping has always been the same and very little has changed. While shopping for goods took to the internet, shopping for food was still not as convenient as it could be. Haste makes it easy for young or old, shopping noob or shopping veteran.

                            Creating this application I came to realize the many differences I made in design due to my A/B testing. I became conflicted with a lot of design choices because what I thought was really good turns out wasn’t so good. I was so caught up thinking a certain design was great without actually looking at it. So asking for another pair of eyes is always helpful. It is like asking someone else to proofread your essay. Being caught up in a certain design could be a terrible idea and I know that now. I failed on many occasions to figure that out. Once I did realize this I was able to create an even better design. Its okay to love your work but always be ready to improve or maybe make something totally different. I learned this while creating the homepage as shown in the preference tests. It went from a simple design to something totally different and a lot more appealing with added features I never thought about until I was challenged with the task. I couldn’t ask for more and sometimes the process could be a little frustrating but I enjoyed every second of it to see where it was and where Haste is now.
