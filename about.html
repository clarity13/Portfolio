                <h2 class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12 vertical-padding">A little about myself</h2>
                <h6 class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12 font-italic text-center">“So I’m finally doing something I love to do. It has been a long journey but everything that I’ve done has brought me straight here.”</h6>
                <h5 class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12 vertical-padding">The Seed</h5>
                <p class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">Growing up, I’ve always loved the idea of creating or sticking out from the crowd. Studying economics in NYC was a choice that was made off the bat because it was a great way to see data analytically. After graduating, I got a job in Accounting where learning how to be precise and to make sure all the numbers add up was a must.</p>
                <p class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 colxl-12">The idea of designing in some sort of aspect was always in the back of my mind and as you know you can’t do creative accounting. After sometime I decided to take the leap to pursue something creative instead of thinking about it. I went out and bought a camera and started to blog for a little to just get the creative juices flowing. I enjoyed having people look at what I can create and if it helped them in any way that would be wonderful. During this time I started doing some research on what fits best for myself and someone mentioned UX Design.</p>
                <h5 class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12 vertical-padding">The Growth</h5>
                <p class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">Being able to take a step back from working and to chase my creativity, and to just be a lot happier. I was always in awe watching others use programs to design, edit, and create. So I started to take the time to learn instead of waiting. I was always the type to try everything on my own and if something intrigued me enough I would set out to learn it. This is when I applied to General Assemblys Accelerated Digital Marketing course. It amazes me how getting to know your potential customers through analytics was just like getting to know your users through user research in UX Design even though I didn’t know it at the time.</p>
                <p class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">I began to look up UX Design after sometime after pursuing everything I wanted to do instead of sitting on it. I knew I wanted to do something that was based off technology and to be creative. I found Bloc.io and the curriculum really made me want to invest into it to make that career change. Being able to use my photography, digital marketing, and critical thinking as well as UX Design seemed like a great idea to me because it felt like they were all similar in their own way.</p>
                <h5 class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12 vertical-padding">The Tree</h5>
                <p class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">Career changes are never easy and telling your loved ones you are doing it can be tough. But I knew I was doing it for myself and I felt happier knowing I was heading in the right direction. During my journey with Bloc.io I learned all the tools of the trade and even created something from nothing which I never thought was possible. I even had my first client during the course which I was super excited about. Being able to work side by side with a mentor and the community to help made it all that much easier to achieve.</p>
                <p class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">Now I am a full blown UX Designer and I am ready to design with the user experience in mind. When I am not in front of the computer, I enjoy going to the gym, photography and exploring everywhere. I also don’t mind being in front of the computer even if it’s not work because I’ll be busy playing video games with some friends or new people I’ve met online. Believe it or not I’ve met a lot of great people online who have actually became great friends. </p>
                <h6 class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12 font-italic vertical-padding text-center">Now that you know my journey, would you like to be part of my future? Let’s create something!</h6>
